Installation instructions for Windows and MAC OSX can be found in the VirtualBox folder (MS Word document) or as videos in the videos folder of this repository: VB_WIN_INSTALL.mov for Windows computers, VB_OSX_INSTALL.mov for Mac computers. These files can be downloaded and opened with most common media players
